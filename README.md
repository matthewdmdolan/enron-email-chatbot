# llm-enron-email-analysis

LLMs are the hot topic at the moment, with LinkedIn dominated by posts about the applications of ChatGPT in the work environment, alongside a lot of scaremongering surrounding the unethical applications of 
the technologies and unintended consequences of their applications. Namely, taking over some jobs. 

Therefore, I wanted to see if I could build a chat bot that would able to reply to emails in a way that would be able to 
automate some of the repetiive administrator roles I worked in during my youth, to identify just how successful AI would be at 'taking our jobs'. 

However, a lot of the popular datasets for LLMs aren't (at least on first glance) optimised for this task. For example, The Google Blogger Corpus (Goohttps://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm) is another popular dataset 
but I felt blogs were typically framed to be more educational than your average day-to-day email sent in a corporate environment. 

Eventually, I stumbled upon the enron dataset (source: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/).  



There are some amazing open source technologies that allow you to quickly build LLMS e.g. flowise, which I did use to develop a PoC to see if I'm on the right lines with utilising the dataset, but 
this was more a task to develop my understanding of the workings behind this new technology that's supposedly going to turn our lives into a utopia, or mad max dystopia. Depending on what Linkedin posts you believe. 






Ultimately, at the moment the model is still largely conceptual due to the necessary computing power needed to
